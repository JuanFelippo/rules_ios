 *
 *  Discussion:
 *      When +authorizationStatus == kCLAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined,
 *      calling this method will trigger a prompt to request "when-in-use"
 *      authorization from the user.  If possible, perform this call in response
 *      to direct user request for a location-based service so that the reason
 *      for the prompt will be clear.  Any authorization change as a result of
 *      the prompt will be reflected via the usual delegate callback:
 *      -locationManager:didChangeAuthorizationStatus:.
 *
 *      If received, "when-in-use" authorization grants access to the user's
 *      location via -startUpdatingLocation/-startRangingBeaconsInRegion while
 *      in the foreground.  If updates have been started when going to the
 *      background, then a status bar banner will be displayed to maintain
 *      visibility to the user, and updates will continue until stopped
 *      normally, or the app is killed by the user.
 *
 *      "When-in-use" authorization does NOT enable monitoring API on regions,
 *      significant location changes, or visits, and -startUpdatingLocation will
 *      not succeed if invoked from the background.
 *
 *      When +authorizationStatus != kCLAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined, (ie
 *      generally after the first call) this method will do nothing.
 *
 *      If the NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription key is not specified in your
 *      Info.plist, this method will do nothing, as your app will be assumed not
 *      to support WhenInUse authorization.
